        identify if a paragraph has a falsity in it with 70% certainty (so, given some false statement, the algorithm will \
        correctly identify it as false 70% of the time), and a sentence with 70% certainty. Alice's company FactCheckersRUS  \
        provides it's customers with fact checking services. Their team of human fact checkers want to use Alice's algorithm  \
        to improve their productivity.  \
        Design an interface for a desktop computer that can assist the fact checking team. This team are experienced fact checkers who use a variety of web sources to validate/invalidate assertions. \
        While designing this interface, take some creative liberties with what the algorithm can do. It can detect with 90% certainty, but make some room for Alice to make improvements, and even suggest some by showing her how new capabilities could be incorporated into your design.",
