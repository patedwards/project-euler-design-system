## What is Project Norman

I feel similarly about UX desig now as I did when I first started coding. When trying
to come up with a fun, somewhat contrived example of a product that needed a design system, I thought about project 
Euler. I learned to code by doing these exercises. They taught me a lot about the basics, and and about mathematics.

I want to try and make a set of problems that people can use to practice their designing skills.

I'm doing this to become a better designer and to build a product that I think is cool, even if it's a little niche.

First steps:
* create 10 problems and solve them myself
* if I do that, then I get to make a website (projectnorman.co) where I post problems and request solutions
* * solutions are submitted by pasting in the github URL of the code to be deplyed. Gets deployed by github to a temporary URL

Problem list:

* Create a time tracker.
* Create an alarm clock (100x200 pixels)
* * the AI will try and set an alarm for 3 minutes after the time it starts using it. It will say success if it can successfully set the alarm and be notified that it's going off after 3 minutes.
