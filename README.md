## What is Project Norman

I feel similarly about UX desig now as I did when I first started coding. When trying
to come up with a fun, somewhat contrived example of a product that needed a design system, I thought about project 
Euler. I learned to code by doing these exercises. They taught me a lot about the basics, and and about mathematics. They gave me the 
simple problems I needed to get started.

I want to try and make a set of problems that people can use to practice their designing skills.

If the idea is to provide enough to get started, should we require coding? My thinking is yes. The purpose of PN is two-fold - learn to design AND
learn to code, just like PE is about learning mathematics AND learning to code.

I'm doing this to become a better designer and to build a product that I think is cool, even if it's a little niche.

First steps:
* create 10 problems and solve them myself
* if I do that, then I get to make a website (projectnorman.co) where I post problems and request solutions
* * solutions are submitted by pasting in the github URL of the code to be deplyed. Gets deployed by github to a temporary URL

Problem list:

* Create a time tracker.
* Create an alarm clock (100x200 pixels)
* * the AI will try and set an alarm for 3 minutes after the time it starts using it. It will say success if it can successfully set the alarm and be notified that it's going off after 3 minutes.
* what are some examples from DOET
* * design a door that a naive user won't know how to open. Rules:
* * * no random numbers!
* * * user needs to get it eventually (can't be impossible), but you get more points for if they can't get it in 3 goes
* * * can use any signifier you want
* Mockup a warning page
* A smart mirror for Alice:
* * Alice likes to take her time getting ready in the morning. She doesn't like to listen to things
